        <h1>How to create a repository on Github</h1>
        <h2>1. Sign up for Github</h2>
        <img src="GithubSignIn.PNG" />
        <p>(you can create a free account)</p>
        <h2>2. Create a new repository</h2>
        <img src="NewRepository.PNG" />
        <img src="NewRepository2.PNG" />
        <p>Sign into your new Github account. At the top you will see a tab for repositories, click it. There will then be a green button named "New", click on that. You will be brought to a page where you can name your new repository, add a description, and decide if you want it to be public or private. Once you make those decisions click the green "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <h2>3. Select upload existing file<h3>
        <img src="ExistingFile.PNG" />
        <p>You will be brought to a new page where you will have the option to upload an existing file, this is where you will click.</p>
        <h2>4. Create you HTML file</h2>
        <img src="CreateHTML.PNG" />
        <p>You can now go to your editor (I use Visual Studios) and create your HTML file.</p>
        <h2>5. Upload your HTML file</h2>
        <img src="UploadHTML.PNG" />
        <p>Once your HTML file is created you will be able to copy and paste it (you can also drag and drop). Once you confirm that all of your files upload then you will scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green button "Commit changes"</p>
        <h2>6. Check to make sure it uploaded correctly</h2>
        <p>You will now be able to see the changes to your page when you refresh it or search your URL in a seperate tab.</p>
